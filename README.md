## What is this folder use for?
- As a documentation for later.
- Adding to my prolifo, for finding a job in datascientist/MLEng position
- Sharing to social network


## Enviroment 
Most of the notebook is created by google colab platform

## Materials/References 
The detail information is put in each note book, most of it come from:
- [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
